## Learning Objectives
----------------------
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/ "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:
### General

*   How to create a Python package
*   How to create a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module
*   What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
*   How to serialize and deserialize a Class
*   How to write and read a JSON file
*   How to manage `datetime`
*   What is an `UUID`
*   What is `*args` and how to use it
*   What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
*   How to handle named arguments in a function

Requirements
------------
### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
*   All your files should end with a new line
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
*   A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
*   All your files must be executable
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
*   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
*   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
*   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
*   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
### Python Unit Tests
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
*   All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
*   All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
*   All your files should end with a new line
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
